# 687-refinforcement-learning

In this project, we implemented two seminal policy gradient methods, namely Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our implementations make use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to play two Atari games (Pong and Breakout) from the Gymnasium library. We referred extensively to the original papers introducing DQN and PPO to choose the hyperparameters and policy/value network architecture. Hyperparameter optimization was limited to the optimizer’s learning rate (and the clipping threshold for PPO’s loss) due to time and computing resource constraints involved in training CNNs. Our results demonstrate that the implementations are capable of learning from purely visual domains and even achieving comparable performance to the original papers’ findings.
